# ENSF 409 Final Project

## Description
This is a final project for ENSF 409 offered by the University of Calgary. It is a food management system for a foodbank complete with automatically making food hampers based on household needs, connecting and updating a SQL database, and a frontend GUI.

### What It Does
This program asks for how many households need to be fed, and then the members of each household. It then connects to a pre-defined SQL database to check if there is enough food for all the households. If so, it will assemble the hampers for each household with suffecient calories for a week, and then remove any distributed food from the database. Finally, it will give a report on all actions done.

### Technologies Used
The main technology used was Java with no extra imports.

## Installation
This project can be used like any other Java classes.

## Usage
Please do not use this project for anything other than reference.
